`vufs`: VUOS virtual filesystems
====

## Overview                                                                     
The Virtual File System (VUFS) provides a mechanism for virtualizing file system operations within the VUOS project. It implements a layered approach to managing file operations such as **binding**, **mergin    g**, **copy-on-write (COW)**, and **minimal COW** through an use of automata to manage the various states of operations.
