`vufuse`: VUOS FUSE
====

Using [FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) it is possible for
users to run file systems implementation in user space. Using the device `/dev/fuse` a kernel module acts as a _bridge_ to the VFS interface.

`vufuse` provides the same service (and it almost completely source code compatible with
FUSE). There are notable differences:

* `vufuse` does not require kernel code,
* FUSE mounted file systems are _visible_ for all the processes while `vufuse` mounted
file systems can be seen only by the processes running under the control of the `umvu`
hypervisor.

vuos provides two modules to support filesystems in userspace: `fuse` and `vufuse`.

* `fuse` (described [here](vudevfuse.md)) is compatible with the file system implementations developed for Linux FUSE.
* `vufuse` (described in this page) requires the generation of a specific plugin (a shared library), it is faster.

Warning: `vufuse` support is being updated from fuse2 to fuse3. Some examples of this tutorial
could fail. We'll try to complete this migration as soon as possible.

## vufuseext2: ext2/3/4 filesystems

The submodule `vufuseext2` supports ext2, etx3 and ext4 file systems.

The following shell session performs these steps:

* create an empty file named `img.ext2`
* configure the file as an ext2 file system
* mount the file system on `/mnt`
* a list of `/mnt` shows that there is only the `lost+found` directory.
* create the file /mnt/greetings in the ext2 file system,
* unmount and remount the partition
* show the contents of `/mnt/greetings`
* unmount the partition
* show that the file syste, is correct

Attention: Mounting a file system is a dangerous operation, valuable data could be lost
in case of erroneous operations of software bugs. So `vufuseext2` requires the flag `rw+`
instead of the default `rw` to provide read-write access to the file system.
Users must be aware of the dangers and voluntarily add that plus sign in the option.

```bash
$$ vu_insmod vufuse
$$ truncate -s 10M img.ext2
$$ /sbin/mkfs.ext2 img.ext2

The operation can be graphically represented as follows:

As a second and more realistic example let us mount the file system image `BusyBox-1.21.1-amd64-root_fs`
that we have already introduces in section [VDE and Virtual Machines](vde_vm.md).

This file is available in the
[tutorial resource page](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~renzo/virtualsquare/tutorial_resources/).

The following sequence of commands mounts that file system image on `/mnt/`.

```bash
$$ vu_insmod vufuse
$$ vumount -t vufuseext2 -o ro /home/user/BusyBox-1.21.1-amd64-root_fs /mnt
$$ ls /mnt
bin  dev  etc  linuxrc  lost+found  proc  root  sbin  sys  usr
$$
```

## vufusefatfs: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 and exFAT.

This module can mount FAT file systems (up to 10).

For example let us download the installation floppy disk of 
[FreeDOS 1.2](https://www.freedos.org/download/).

```
$$ vu_insmod vufuse
$$ wget http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/1.2/official/FD12FLOPPY.zip

...
$$ unzip FD12FLOPPY.zip 
Archive:  FD12FLOPPY.zip
  inflating: FLOPPY.img              
  inflating: README.md               
$$ vumount -t vufusefatfs -o ro /home/user/FLOPPY.img /mnt
$$ ls /mnt
AUTOEXEC.BAT  COMMAND.COM  FDCONFIG.SYS  FDSETUP  KERNEL.SYS  SETUP.BAT
```
...
```
$$ vuumount/mnt
```

## vufusearchive: iso, tar, zip (including compressed archives)

In this exammple the iso image `alpine-virt-3.12.0_rc5-x86_64.iso` is mounted on `/mnt`:

```bash
$$ vu_insmod vufuse
$$ vumount  -t vufusearchive -o ro /home/user/alpine-virt-3.12.0_rc5-x86_64.iso /mnt
$$ ls /mnt
apks  boot  efi
```
...
```
$$ vuumount /mnt
```

The following example shows how to mount the compressed archive
`alpine-minirootfs-3.12.0-x86_64.tar.gz`:

```bash
$$ vu_insmod vufuse
$$ vumount  -t vufusearchive -o ro /home/user/alpine-minirootfs-3.12.0-x86_64.tar.gz /mnt

$$ ls /mnt
bin  etc   lib    mnt  proc  run   srv  tmp  var
dev  home  media  opt  root  sbin  sys  usr
```
...
```
$$ vuumount /mnt
```

## Other file system types

Note: ![wip](pictures/wip.png) we are currently porting the support for more file system
types and we are working on the alignment with the latest developments of FUSE.
